Onboarding Approach 1:

useEffect(() => {
  const isNewUser = user?.is_new && !profile?.isOnboarded
  if (isNewUser) navigate('/onboarding')
}, [user, profile, navigate])



Notes

In the pages directory, all components have a <main> tag as their outermost wrapper element.
Features make use of the ContentLayout, which consists of a <main> tag and <nav>


Should ErrorMsg go outside of core app?
Might need to refactor use of ErrorMsg in App.jsx if that component is used elsewhere
