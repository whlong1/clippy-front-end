Onboarding Approach 1:

useEffect(() => {
  const isNewUser = user?.is_new && !profile?.isOnboarded
  if (isNewUser) navigate('/onboarding')
}, [user, profile, navigate])



Notes

In the pages directory, all components have a <main> tag as their outermost wrapper element.
These components are outside of our core app functionality and do not make use of wrapper layouts.
