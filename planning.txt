Onboarding Approach 1:

useEffect(() => {
  const isNewUser = user?.is_new && !profile?.isOnboarded
  if (isNewUser) navigate('/onboarding')
}, [user, profile, navigate])



Notes

In the pages directory, all components have a <main> tag as their outermost wrapper element.
Features make use of the ContentLayout, which consists of a <main> tag and <nav>


Should ErrorMsg go outside of core app?
Might need to refactor use of ErrorMsg in App.jsx if that component is used elsewhere




Onboarding flow
  user signs up
  user is directed to onboarding
  user fills out profile info
  profile is updated - isProfileComplete set to true

  with profile fields filled out, user can join cohort
  user recieves message to wait for admittance
  when an instructor approves a student, set isOnboarded to true
    * modify approveProfile controller function to toggle isOnboarded
